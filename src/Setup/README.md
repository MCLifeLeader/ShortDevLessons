# Setup

## Dev Container

This project has been configured to run from a GitHub Dev Container. If you are not familiar with this, I have some instructions below on what you can do to get your computer configured for writing code.

## Scripts

I have included several scripts that can be used to help setup and configure your computer. If you are unfamiliar with what a Dev Container is, no worries, running one of the following scripts should automatically configure your computer for writing software code. These scripts are taylor made for one of three primary operating systems.

- Windows
- iOS for Mac
- Ubuntu Linux

Should the automatic configuration script fail, manual installation steps can be found below.

### Windows

- Locate the script named [See /src/setup-windows.ps1 for details](/src/setup-windows.ps1)
-

### iOS

- Locate the script named [See /src/setup-mac.sh for details](/src/setup-mac.sh)

### Ubuntu

- Locate the script named [See /src/setup-ubuntu.sh for details](/src/setup-ubuntu.sh)

## Manual Install Steps

To manually install the .NET SDK and set up VSCode, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the .NET SDK from the official Microsoft website: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

2. Choose the appropriate version of the .NET SDK for your operating system and click on the download link.

3. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the .NET SDK.

4. Install VSCode from the website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

5. After the installation is complete, open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

6. Install the C# extension for VSCode. You can do this by opening the Extensions view in VSCode (Ctrl+Shift+X), searching for "C#" in the search bar, and clicking on the "C#" extension by Microsoft.

7. Once the extension is installed, you may need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.

8. Now you can start writing C# applications using the .NET SDK in VSCode.

Please note that these steps assume you have already installed VSCode on your system. If you haven't, you can download it from the official VSCode website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
