# Introduction

This repository hosts class materials for a series of short developer lessons for homeschooler's who want to teach their children the basics of programming. Grades: 6-12

When creating a lesson plan for teaching the basics of programming, it's important to choose a language that is beginner-friendly, has a simple syntax, and allows students to quickly see results. One of the most popular and recommended programming languages for new programmers is **Python**. Hereâ€™s why Python is an excellent choice for beginners:

## Reasons to Choose Python:

1. **Simple and Readable Syntax**:
   - Python's syntax is clear and easy to understand, which makes it easier for beginners to grasp fundamental programming concepts without getting bogged down by complex syntax rules.
   - Code readability is emphasized, which helps students learn the importance of writing clean, understandable code.

2. **Versatility**:
   - Python is a versatile language used in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. This allows students to explore different areas of interest using the same language.
   
3. **Large Community and Abundant Resources**:
   - Python has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of tutorials, documentation, and forums available to help beginners.
   - Numerous educational resources, including books, online courses, and interactive tutorials, are available for free or at a low cost.

4. **Immediate Feedback with Interactive Shell**:
   - Python provides an interactive shell (REPL) that allows students to type code and see immediate results. This is great for experimenting with code and learning through trial and error.

5. **Extensive Standard Library and Third-Party Modules**:
   - Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that enables beginners to perform many tasks without needing to install additional packages.
   - A vast array of third-party modules and libraries are available for more specialized tasks, which students can explore as they advance.
